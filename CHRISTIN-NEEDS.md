# What We Need from Christin

> Items needed to populate the site with real data and finalize integrations.

## Toast Integration

### Toast URLs (Priority)
We need the actual Toast URLs for Manna's account. Right now we have placeholders.

- [ ] Online ordering URL (e.g. `https://order.toasttab.com/online/your-slug`)
- [ ] Menu page URL
- [ ] Gift cards purchase URL
- [ ] Rewards / loyalty signup URL
- [ ] Customer sign-in URL
- [ ] Cart URL (may just be part of the ordering flow)

### Toast API Access (If pulling live data)
If Christin wants menu items, prices, and photos displayed directly on the site (instead of just linking to Toast), we need:

- [ ] **Restaurant GUID** — unique identifier in Toast's system
- [ ] **API Client ID & Client Secret** — from the Toast Developer portal or Toast rep
  - Scoped to **read-only** access for:
    - **Menus API** — menu groups, items, descriptions, prices, images
    - **Restaurant API** — hours, location, contact info
    - **Stock API** — item availability (86'd / out of stock items)

### Toast Display Decision
- [ ] Does Christin want the **menu pulled live via API** and displayed on the site, or just **link out to Toast's menu page**?
- [ ] Same question for **gift cards** — embed or link?
